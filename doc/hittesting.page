<h1 id="hit-testing">Hit Testing</h1>
<p>Hit testing lets you find the character cluster that a co-ordinate
is either directly over and/or closest to.  This can be used to be build a range
selection feature and/or as part of a more comprehensive editor.</p>
<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">// Hit test a mouse co-ordinate for example
var htr = tb.HitTest(x, y);
</code></pre>
<p>The co-ordinates passed to the <a href="./ref/Topten.RichTextKit.RichString.HitTest">RichString.HitTest</a> and <a href="./ref/Topten.RichTextKit.TextBlock.HitTest">TextBlock.HitTest</a>
methods must be relative to the top-left corner of the object. (ie: you'll probably
need to adjust the co-ordinates by subtracting the top-left position of where you're
displaying the text block).</p>
<p>The returned <a href="./ref/Topten.RichTextKit.HitTestResult">HitTestResult</a> structure describes the line
and code point cluster the point is either directly over and/or closest to.</p>
