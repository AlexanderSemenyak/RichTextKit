<h1 id="caret-information">Caret Information</h1>
<p>The caret is the flashing cursor that's typically shown in a text editor
to show the current insert position.  Although RichTextKit doesn't provide
any editing capabilities, it does include the ability to calculate where
the caret should be displayed.</p>
<p>To determine where the caret should be displayed, call the
<a href="./ref/Topten.RichTextKit.TextBlock.GetCaretInfo">GetCaretInfo</a>
method which will return a <a href="./ref/Topten.RichTextKit.CaretInfo">CaretInfo</a> structure describing
where the caret should be drawn, the shape of the caret (sloped for italic) and
other useful details about the current caret position.</p>
